As computation and memory speed improve over time,\n *  increasing the difficulty maintains the cost of an attacker.\n *\n *  For example, if a target time of 5 seconds is used, a legitimate user\n *  which knows their password requires only 5 seconds to unlock their\n *  account. A 6 character password has 68 billion possibilities, which\n *  would require an attacker to invest over 10,000 years of CPU time.
